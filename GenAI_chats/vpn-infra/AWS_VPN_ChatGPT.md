## Asking for a deployable AWS VPN solution

What follows is a transcript between the requester and ChatGPT. The goal was to create a full VPN Infra solution with client configuration using ChatGPT at each step. My prompts are coded as blockquotes:

> I have an AWS account and want to create a VPN to appear my connection is coming from the US for testing purposes (I am an SRE and need to test regional connectivity for our services). Create an AWS VPN service I can deploy quickly in any AWS region.

I‚Äôll generate Terraform scripts for an AWS VPN service that you can quickly deploy in any AWS region. The setup will include:
	1.	EC2 Instance: A lightweight Linux-based instance (e.g., Amazon Linux 2) to act as the VPN server.
	2.	OpenVPN: Installed and configured automatically.
	3.	Elastic IP: To ensure a stable public IP address.
	4.	Security Groups: To allow VPN traffic (UDP 1194 by default).
	5.	Auto Region Selection: Deployable to any AWS region.

I‚Äôll generate the Terraform code for you now.

[Generated AWS APN Terraform](generated-aws-vpn.tf)

This Terraform script sets up an AWS-based OpenVPN server that you can deploy quickly. You can modify the aws_region variable to any AWS region you need. Let me know if you need additional configurations! üöÄ

>Can this be modified to use t4g.micro?


I‚Äôve updated the instance type to t4g.micro. Let me know if you need any other modifications! üöÄ

>Got an error:

>Error: associating EC2 EIP (eipalloc-07582a7b68a8c443e): operation error EC2: AssociateAddress, https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: 2e58125c-3cb1-4954-ab26-b143531edcfe, api error Gateway.NotAttached: Network vpc-0275fcefb5f990e79 is not attached to any internet gateway

The error suggests that the VPC does not have an Internet Gateway (IGW) attached, preventing the Elastic IP (EIP) from being assigned to the instance. I‚Äôll modify your Terraform script to include an Internet Gateway (IGW) and attach it to the VPC, as well as a proper route table to ensure the instance has outbound internet access.

I‚Äôll make these changes now.

I‚Äôve added an Internet Gateway (IGW), a Route Table, and an Association to ensure your instance gets public internet access. This should resolve the Gateway.NotAttached error. Try deploying again and let me know if you hit any other issues! üöÄ

>Great! Now, how do I create a connection from my Mac OS Macbook to use the VPN? How about my iPhone?

To connect your MacBook and iPhone to the AWS OpenVPN server, follow these steps:

To connect your MacBook and iPhone to the AWS OpenVPN server, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve the VPN Configuration File

Once your Terraform setup is complete, log into your AWS instance to retrieve the OpenVPN client configuration file (.ovpn).

**SSH into the VPN instance**

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<vpn_ip>
```

Replace <vpn_ip> with the output from Terraform.

**Find the generated .ovpn file**

OpenVPN setup script generates a client profile in:

```bash
ls /root/
```

Look for a .ovpn file (e.g., client.ovpn).

Download the .ovpn file to your local machine

On your **MacBook**, run:

```bash
scp -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<vpn_ip>:/root/client.ovpn ~/Downloads/client.ovpn
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up VPN on MacBook

**Install OpenVPN Client**

Download Tunnelblick, a free OpenVPN client for macOS:  
* [Download Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net)

**Import Configuration**   
	1.	Open Tunnelblick.    
	2.	Drag & drop the client.ovpn file into Tunnelblick.  
	3.	Click Connect and enter any credentials if prompted.  

Once connected, your traffic will be routed through the AWS VPN.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up VPN on iPhone

Install OpenVPN Connect.   
	1.	Download OpenVPN Connect from the App Store:  
	‚Ä¢	Download OpenVPN Connect. 

**Transfer Configuration to iPhone**  
There are multiple ways to transfer the .ovpn file:  
	‚Ä¢	**Airdrop**: Send the .ovpn file from your Mac to your iPhone.  
	‚Ä¢	**Email**: Email the file to yourself and open it on your iPhone.  
	‚Ä¢	**iCloud Drive**: Save it in iCloud and open it from the OpenVPN app.  

**Import and Connect**  
	1.	Open OpenVPN Connect.  
	2.	Tap Import Profile ‚Üí File and select the client.ovpn file.  
	3.	Tap Add and then Connect.  

Now, your iPhone is securely connected to your AWS VPN.

üéØ **Verification**

To verify that your traffic is routed through the VPN, check your public IP:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

If the IP matches your AWS VPN instance, it‚Äôs working!

Let me know if you run into any issues! üöÄ

> I want to alias a host name in my ssh config file, what's the format? Example, I want to alias 198.168.10.1 as mgmt-point

You can configure an alias for your SSH connections by editing your `~/.ssh/config` file. Here‚Äôs the format:

```ini
Host mgmt-point  
    HostName 198.168.10.1  
    User your-username  
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

**Explanation**:  
	‚Ä¢	Host mgmt-point ‚Üí This is the alias you will use in SSH commands.  
	‚Ä¢	HostName 198.168.10.1 ‚Üí The actual IP or hostname of the server.  
	‚Ä¢	User your-username ‚Üí Your SSH username (e.g., ec2-user for AWS, root for some servers).  
	‚Ä¢	IdentityFile `~/.ssh/your-key.pem` ‚Üí The SSH private key file (if applicable).    

**Usage**

Once you have added this entry to` ~/.ssh/config`, you can connect using:

```bash
ssh mgmt-point
```

instead of:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem your-username@198.168.10.1
```
Let me know if you need additional options! üöÄ

>Create an ssh options file that sends fingerprints to /dev/null, doesn't require a fingerprint, keeps the connection open

Here‚Äôs an SSH config file that meets your requirements:  
	‚Ä¢	Sends fingerprints to /dev/null  
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt require a fingerprint (no strict checking)  
	‚Ä¢	Keeps the connection open  

I‚Äôll generate the file now.

```ini
Host *
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking=no
    ServerAliveInterval=60
    ServerAliveCountMax=5
    TCPKeepAlive=yes
```
