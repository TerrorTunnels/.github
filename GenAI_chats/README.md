Seemed appropriate to include the prompts and chats with ChatGPT and Claude that resulted in this project, and so I did just that.

[Serverless_API.md](api-setup/Serverless_API.md) - Next we need to create the serverless REST API service | ChatGPT 4o

[ios-app/iOS_app.md](ios-app/iOS_app.md) - Finally, we come to the iOS app to use the REST API to control the state of the VPN | Claude 3.7 Sonnet & ChatGPT 4o
